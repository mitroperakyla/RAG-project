# RAG-project
I have been currently investigating and learning some AI-based solutions. RAG could be one of those solutions I would like to know better.
The final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

I want to learn and investigate more about the possibilities of RAG in different industries and in personal use.
I would like to build a RAG-based solution for searching different documents from external data sources remotely.
An example could be some start-up engineer with access to the company's internal data source. The ultimate goal would
be that the engineer could use an AI-based solution to find any document from the internal database. 


## Background

RAG solutions are not widely used yet, and it seems that these could be potential future tools.



## How is it used?

The engineer should have an application on the phone or computer. Then this solution should be connected to the internal
cloud database.
Just by writing the text to the application, it should offer the best possible document, etc. from the database
based on the written text.


## Data sources and AI methods

This solution needs LLM and access to cloud-based data sources, such as Sharepoint.
Data sources are still unclear.

## Challenges

It is not possible to make sure that the information the solution provides is 100% correct or updated.

## What next?

I am not that familiar with coding, or AI solutions.
I need support in software development and maintenance.
